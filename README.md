&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you still buying a DC brush motor drive module in about 3<span>$</span>? Are you still worried about the high noise in addition to the already low response speed and life? Allow me to present you our project, miniFOC---- a FOC brushless motor control scheme that can get you the most bang for your buck, for just 3 <span>$</span>!  **miniFOC** has a built-in torque closed-loop controller so that you can control a brushless motor with a 3-wire UART port. The software and hardware design are fully compliant with the AGPL-3.0 open source license.

### Brief Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This open-source project aims to accomplish a FOC(Field Oriented Control) scheme that is operatable with minimum costs in China. The components selected in the example circuit are all manufactured in China. FOC possesses various advantages when it comes to controlling BLCD (Brushless Direct Current) motor; some of the benefits are as follows:

1. FOC has no speed limit at all and can be accurately controlled at any speed
2. FOC excels at its reversing performance, ensuring the smoothness of forward and reverse switching even when running at its highest speed
3. FOC can also perform braking control in the form of energy recovery.
4. FOC can achieve three closed-loop control of torque, speed, and position.
5. FOC has significantly lower noise but much higher efficiency compared that of electric regulation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although FOC has many advantages, its large amount of calculation and complex principles requires an expensive controller, which made FOC unpopular. After half a year’s research and iteration, I deeply optimized the part of the code that implements mass calculations and re-selected its components to fit the domestic supply chain. I hope this open-source project can help domestic developers use BLDC motors with excellent performance and contribute to the open-source community.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As can be seen from the table above, the scheme adopted by **miniFOC** can achieve high performance at low cost. At the same time, due to the re-selection according to the domestic supply chain, the selection of devices is not so limited, and there are many alternatives. amid the chip shortage in 2021, the cost of FOC still can be controlled at about 3$, which further proves the degree of cost optimization and the great potential of the project.
